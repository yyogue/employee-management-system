# Employee Management System üè¢üîí

## Overview

This project helps employers securely manage their employees, preventing unauthorized payments and fraud. The system ensures that only authorized personnel can add new employees, and each employee is linked to the person who registered them, creating full accountability.

## Problem Solved

Previously, the employer faced issues where unauthorized individuals were added to the payroll, leading to financial losses. With this system:

- Only a few trusted users can add new employees.
- Each new employee is tagged with the ID of the person who registered them.
- This prevents payroll fraud and ensures only real employees get paid.

## Features

- **‚úÖ Secure Employee Registration** ‚Äì Only authorized personnel can add employees.
- **‚úÖ User Accountability** ‚Äì Every added employee is linked to their registrar.
- **‚úÖ Fraud Prevention** ‚Äì No more paying ghost employees.
- **‚úÖ Role-Based Access** ‚Äì Different levels of access for security.

## Technologies Used

- **Mongoose:** A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **Express:** A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yogue1997/blogBackEndNodeApi.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd blogBackEndNodeApi
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up MongoDB connection:

   - Create a MongoDB database.
   - Update the MongoDB connection string in the project files where necessary.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The project should now be running locally. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to access the application.

## Future Plans

In the future, the project will be expanded with the following technologies:

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It will be used for creating a dynamic and interactive frontend.
- **React Native:** A framework for building mobile applications using React. It will be used to extend the project to mobile platforms.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the community and resources that have helped me learn and build this project. It's my current most proud accomplishment in my learning journey, and I look forward to the future development of this blog platform.
