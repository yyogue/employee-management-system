# Blog Project

This project is a personal blog platform where users can create and share their own blogs. It serves as a social media app for bloggers to connect and express their thoughts. The backend of the project is built using Mongoose, Express, and Node.js, and it successfully connects to a MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

- **Mongoose:** A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- **Express:** A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yogue1997/blogBackEndNodeApi.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd blogBackEndNodeApi
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up MongoDB connection:

   - Create a MongoDB database.
   - Update the MongoDB connection string in the project files where necessary.

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The project should now be running locally. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to access the application.

## Future Plans

In the future, the project will be expanded with the following technologies:

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It will be used for creating a dynamic and interactive frontend.
- **React Native:** A framework for building mobile applications using React. It will be used to extend the project to mobile platforms.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the community and resources that have helped me learn and build this project. It's my current most proud accomplishment in my learning journey, and I look forward to the future development of this blog platform.
