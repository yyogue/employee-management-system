# Employee Management System - Frontend 🏢🔒

## Overview

This is the front-end part of the Employee Management System that works in conjunction with the backend to securely manage employees. The system ensures that only authorized personnel can add new employees, and every employee added is linked to the person who registered them, creating full accountability.

## Current Status

The front-end is still under development, and I am working on it whenever I get the chance. Stay tuned for updates!


## Features

- **✅ User Authentication** – Secure login system for authorized personnel.
- **✅ Employee Registration Interface** – A user-friendly form for adding new employees.
- **✅ Dashboard** – An overview of employees, registration status, and user activity.
- **✅ Role-Based Access** – Different views and permissions based on user roles.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used for making requests to the backend.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yogue1997/employee-management-frontend.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd employee-management-frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The front-end will now be running locally at http://localhost:3000. You can interact with the system, register new employees (once the backend is fully connected), and explore the available features.

## Future Plans

The project will be expanded with the following features:

- Integration with the backend to securely register employees.
- A polished user interface for a smoother user experience.
- Additional pages and features to complete the full system.
